# YOU SEEN THIS?

## Background

My friend shares a lot of awesome links, to where I had to start tracking a backlog of them. Eventually it became something along the lines of this. I have since been adding other things I have run across. Eventually it would be cool if this could be a reasonably comprehensive reference of programs, resources, commands, theory, hardware and anything else that could be helpful. This could probably do with some more solid organization within the sections. However, at this point I don't feel like there's enough content to justify all the headings that proper organization would require. Additionally I would like to add several other sections, such as one for ctf.

Some of these may be more common knowledge (or useful) than others, but I'm leaving them ~~because I'm lazy~~ for completeness.
